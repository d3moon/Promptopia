## Introduction
I had the opportunity to learn Next.js in a very engaging way recently. This tutorial allowed me to grasp the most important concepts of Next.js and understand how they integrate with the React ecosystem. Moreover, it provided hands-on experience by guiding me through the creation of a modern full-stack Next.js 13 application.

*In this video, I learned the following:*

- Next.js 13 App Folder Structure
- Next.js 13 Client Components vs Server Components
- Next.js 13 File-based Routing (including dynamic and nested routes)
- Next.js 13 Special Files: Pages, Layout, Loading, and Error handling
- Next.js 13 Serverless Route Handlers (Next API, Full Stack Apps)
- Next.js 13 Metadata and Search Engine Optimization - (SEO)
- Three ways to fetch data in Next.js:
- Server Side Rendering (SSR)
- Static Site Generation (SSG)
- Incremental Static Generation (ISR)
